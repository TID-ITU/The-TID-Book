## Introduction to TID
What is Technical Interaction Design? Interaction design is the domain of designing for the interaction between a human and a system. If you find this to read as a very broad definition, you would be correct. Even the word "system" could be argued as too specific. Interaction design is about everything from command-line programs to dishwashers, from operating systems to car dashboards, It encompasses the digital, the physical, the visual, and the tactile.
In this course, we will focus on the process of creating a web application. It is a nice and employable skill to have, but it also serves as a neat vehicle for teaching almost all of the principles found in field of interaction design - principles that are to a large degree transferable to other types of interaction design. This also speaks to the question: What do you mean by "technical"? We believe in learning by doing, and to "do" interaction design, implimentation is nesessary. In the technical part of this course, you will be learning how to convert your designs into software that behaves as you want it to, using modern web technologies.
But there is more to software than what the user sees. An equally important part of the technical aspect is the software design itself. While the user may never see the code underneith, how the code is written has a tremendous impact on the outcome be they bugs, the required effort for added features, or merely the cost of basic maintenance.

### Design thinking
Let us visit the concept of design. When some people hear or read "design" they think about art. Paintings, furniture, clothes. Depending on the art form and the artist, design may be a vital part of the artistic process. Likewise, artestry and aesthetics may play a big role in any given design. The two are *not* the same, however. Design is fundamentally about problems and solutions. Being a designer, regardless of field, is a frame of mind, a way of thinking. 
The framework of Design Thinking offers us 4 central principles:
#### 1. Human-centric
Designing is inherently a social activity.
#### 2. Ambiguity
#### 3. Redesign
#### 4. Tangibility
